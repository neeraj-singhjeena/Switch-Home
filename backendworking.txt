Apartment Location Suggestion Backend Guide
1. Get User Location via Browser (Geolocation API)
Use the browserâ€™s built-in Geolocation API.
Ask for permission; if granted, you get latitude and longitude.
Use these coordinates to suggest nearby apartments.
Example (Frontend):

2. Get Location from Registered User Profile
When a user registers, ask for their city, state, or address.
Save this info in their profile in your database.
Use this location to suggest apartments when they log in.
Example (Backend):

3. Fallback: Use IP-based Location
Use a third-party API (like ipinfo.io or ipapi.co) to get approximate location from IP address.
Less accurate, but works without user permission.
Example (Backend):

4. How to Use Location for Suggestions

Show apartments sorted by nearest first.
Example (Backend):

Summary
Use browser geolocation for visitors.
Use profile location for registered users.
Use IP-based location as a fallback.
